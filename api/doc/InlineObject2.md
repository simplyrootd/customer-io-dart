**filters** | [**OneOfobjectobjectobjectobjectobject**](OneOfobjectobjectobjectobjectobject.md) | When filtering for people, you can use `and` and `or` arrays to determine the logic for a group of filter conditions. `not` reverses the filter condition and matches when the condition is false. `segment` and `attribute` represent the individual conditions you can filter a group of people for.  The top level of this object can only contain a single property, but you can nest `and` and `or` properties to produce complex filters.  |
